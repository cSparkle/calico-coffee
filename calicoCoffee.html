                <h3>About C3</h3>
                <p>Calico Coffee Company was founded in 1997 by two undergraduate engineering students
                    at the University of Michigan. Starbucks had infiltrated every corner of the downtown
                    Ann Arbor area, pushing out the local coffee shops that had lined Main Street for decades.
                    With support from other students, the two realized a new approach was necessary. Calico was
                    opened as a co-op style coffee shop that offers steep discounts to members, veterans, teachers,
                    and city service members.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Calico?</h3>
                <p>Coffee has nothing to do with cats. Or, does it? At Calico, yes. Our founders Greg Wentzel and 
                    Sarah Wilmer spent their childhoods raising stray or disabled cats and kittens, and this hobby
                    followed them to college. But why keep all that cuteness to themselves? They weren't above 
                    using adorable kitties to help sell their coffee then, and they still aren't. 
                    After all, fluffy kitties! Today, Calico is home to 3 beautiful and friendly 
                    fluffballs. They work full-time as door-greeters, leg-warmers, and milk-taste-testers.
